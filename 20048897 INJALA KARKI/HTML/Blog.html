                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I'm injala karki and in this blog post I included my thoughts and opinion on the topic of technology
                    and its use in daily life.
                    The first thing that comes to mind when we hear the word technology is machinery and equipment built
                    by the application of scientific knowledge.
                    As an IT student, I learned that technology has applications that go beyond what I know. It has
                    transformed our lives in many ways, from how we work, live, and play to what our future will be.
                    Almost everybody uses technology, both knowingly and unknowingly. Through the adoption of tools such
                    as the internet and email for communications, word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations
                    for office productivity, electronic databases for record keeping, and machine learning and
                    artificial intelligence for automation, technology has advanced and transformed our daily life in
                    numerous ways.

                <p style="color: white;">The table above depicts the daily requirements of three groups of people in the field of technology. The first is a student.
                    Particularly during this pandemic, technology has been a great help to students, having all classes online to allow them to learn new things on their own.
                    They don' t have to be concerned about missing an academic year or falling behind in their studies.
                It is all possible due to the great applications created due to technology like Zoom, Google classroom,
                Slack, Blackboard and so on. <br>
                <br>
                Another person for whom technology has had a significant impact on their everyday life is farmer. With
                the advent of technology,
                the age where farmers had to work hard to harvest 100 kilos of paddy or wheat, or the tension and
                frustration of waiting for rainfall so that their seeds might sprout, has passed.
                Now, they can simply deliver the seeds online, have enough water supplements, and produce crops.
                The final group is office staff who require extensive use of technology. It will eventually help them in
                providing better services to customers.
                <br>
                <br>
                The number I used to search in bulky register books has been replaced by the application of mobile
                phones. The e-books have limited the amount of books in my bags.
                Because of the advent of cars, the route I used to travel, which took nearly two hours, has been
                shortened. Heavy clothes that we used to hand-wash are now neatly washed in washing machines, and so on.
                That is why technology has had a greater effect on our lives than we realize. And we are gradually
                becoming dependent on them.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, excessive usage will lead to our own downfall. Eye pressure, difficulty concentrating on
                essential activities, and certain severe health problems, such as depression, are examples of
                psychological and physical issues caused by over use of social media and mobile devices. Even the
                harmful chemicals can ruin the crops and the field.
                So, with lots of advantages, technology comes with the demerits too.
                Overall, we know the major things that technology effect according to my view.
