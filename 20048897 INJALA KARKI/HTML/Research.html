                RESEARCH</h1>

            <p>I drew inspiration for my portfolio website from five major websites that caught my attention. I got the
                navigation bar from one of these websites, the blog layout from another, and the CV layout and footer
                from another. In addition, I discovered an incredible contact layout on one website. All of these
                websites have different layouts, designs, and meanings, which I modified in my style to suit my content
                and give my website a beautiful shape.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Navigation bar</h2>
        <figure>
            <section class="image" id="image">
                <img src="../image/portfolio.png" alt="Image">
                <img src="../image/mywebpage.png" alt="Image">
            </section>
        </figure>
        <div>
            <p>
                For my home page, I have taken reference from the website name Portfolio., which was developed by
                codingnepal Prakash Shahi. Overall, the home page consists of the background picture along with the
                creator's photo, and his short description in the left side, with the slideshow feature in the sentence.
                This web page has a navigation bar in the top right corner and a name in the left side with six menu
                options
                that will cause the page to scroll down if the button is pressed.
                <br>
                He made the navigation bar using an unordered list and inside the list he includes the ancho tag for
                each section. As I considered this concept to be a better way to
                create the nav bar, I also used the unordered listing system for my menu choices, and my color scheme is
                similar to his, but unlike him, I gave the blackground color black and mixed it with red.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Blog</h2>
        <section class="image1">
            <img src="../image/blog.png" alt="SS of Blog">
            <img src="../image/myBlog.png" alt="SS of myBlog">
        </section>
        <div>
            <p>
                Another website that I used as a guide is skater, which has nearly identical features and a similar
                coding process. However, the design of this website's blog appeals to me. It appears to be divided into
                two columns of 70% and 30%, but in fact, the developer has made divisions for each line and set display
                as flex for the main division, resulting in this page's appearance. Nonetheless, I just took the layout
                and added my own spin to it. I use the aside tag to indicate that the photo section is in the side
                section, and I divide each paragraph and give it the proper height, width, and margin.I even create
                divisions for each paragraph and table tags to improve in design and formatting.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>CV</h2>
        <section style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">
            <img src="../image/CV.png" alt="CV">
            <img src="../image/myCV.png" alt="myCV">
        </section>
        <div>
            <p>
                Similarly, I use another website called student CV, which offers a variety of CV layouts. Among them,
                the above-mentioned CV piques my interest. It has the well-known layout. It includes the following parts
                at the top right corner: address, phone number, email address, and some social media links, and the body
                part contains objective, education, experience, skills, and activities.
                Instead of using all of the details in the top right corner, I use my name, position, address, phone
                number, and email address in this layout. I represented myself in the body section, then listed my
                skills and soft skills. Then there's my education, work experience, and projects I've completed. Also
                included are the languages I am familiar with, as well as a section on references. The client and user
                can know more about me by contacting the reference mention above.
                ask the reference I described.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <section style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
            <img src="../image/contact.png" alt="Image">
            <img src="../image/myContact.png" alt="Image">
        </section>
        <div>
            <p>
                The website features a button interface and scrolling pages. The contact page has a naming section on
                the left side and a photo on the right side. Initially, the developer placed their details in the top
                left corner, creating rows and columns. I discovered that this web page was created by dividing each
                line and using a form tag by looking at his inspect portion. He has also used division with class row
                and column and give each address, email, and phone 33.33 percent width of total width of left-side
                division.
                So, I like his concept, and I also give it 33.33 % of the total width of the webpage and make
                it horizontal. And for other items, such as the form, I use the form tag by dividing into sections. I
                used input tag for the name and email, the textarera tag for the message area, and the button tag to
                create
                the buttons. I have used the same style as him, with the naming section on the left and the picture on
                the right, my webite takes a beautiful shape.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2>Footer</h2>
        <section style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">
            <img src="../image/footer.png" alt="">
            <img src="../image/myFooter.png" alt="">
        </section>
        <div>
            <p>
                Finally, I got inspiration for the footer segment from the page name unfold. Since it is the designer's
                website, the website seems to be quite appealing to me. The website has a black background with a
                picture of the creator on it. However, instead of having a stunning template and layout. I figured it
                would be best if I designed my footer section similarly to his. He has provided five media links, each
                of which will take us to his respective media link if we click on it. By examining his code, I
                discovered that he also used division by providing rows and columns, as well as division for the copy
                right segment.Instead of using the name of the media connection, I think it would be better if I gave
                them an icon, so I built my footer section with a media link by downloading the
                icon and giving the display flex and a copy right claim below that.
